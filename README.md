## RUBY'S RIDING CENTER
---------------------------

### What is the progect all about?

Ruby's Riding Center is a riding center for children of all ages. We believe children and horses have an amazing connection which builds confidence and healing.
We also cater for children with all types of disabilities be it physical or mental.

Children should all be able to feel normal. Being on, or close to a horse, gives them a special connection that empowers them. Results have been amazing to witness.

### User Experience
---------------------

#### User stories:

 _The site user (The Parent):_

 * As a parent , I want to find a place where my child can learn about horses and how to ride.
 * As a parent, I want to build my childs confidence.
 * As a parent, I want my child to have fun while being safe.
 * As a parent, I want to hear what others have to say about the place.
 * As a parent, I want my child to feel normal.

 For the site user (The Parent), the site assists by fulfilling these goals by:
* Being written in clean aesthetically pleasing code and by being visually stimulating.
* Having a site that is fully responsive.
* Having comments from current and previous parents visable.
* Allowing the parent to be able to contact the school with questions and queries via the "Message us" form.
* Feeling confident that this is a school that meets their needs.

 _As a site owner (The Riding School):_
* The site must be visuallly inviting to both children and their parents.
* It must forfill a need- To get children to come and ride, to grow in confidence around horses and to heal.
* To show the bond that is created between horses and their riders.

_As a developer:_

### Testing:
   ------------
   - **HTML:** The HTML Validator https://validator.w3.org/ was used to validate the HTML code.
   - **CSS:** The CSS Validator https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input was used to validate the css code.
   
   When running both of these validators in the beginning i found a few errors mainly typos and trailing div's. There were also some warnings for code that was correct and could be ignored. On correcting what needed to be corrected,  the code works well.

### Features and responsive testing:

Chrome Dev tools was used alongside all my written code to make sure i was getting the responsiveness and size correct for the different pages.
  
   - **Web-dev:** Web-dev measures your site to see how well it supporst your users and what you can do to increase your rate of support. Handy little tool. 
    - **[My Report](https://lighthouse-dot-webdotdevsite.appspot.com//lh/html?url=https%3A%2F%2Flee-annc.github.io%2FRubys-Riding-Center)**

### Problems and bugs
- **Bootstrap and alignment:** The issue of allignment took me a very long time to sort out. With the help from the folks on slack and my mentor i found that my order for bootstrap was incorrect. I was directed to watch a video which Anna (one of the tutors) made just on bootstrap.
On correcting the order, things seemed to work better.

* Contact form works as it should.
    * Go to the Our Newsletter Sign up
    * if the user does not enter an email the user will get the error - "Please include and @ in the email address".
    * If the user doesn not enter the email correctly and only enters abc@ the error message will say " Please enter the part following the @. This is incomplete.
* This works the same for the "Message Us form".
* this website is responsive from mobile up to large screen resolutions.

### Testing on Web Browsers:

The web browsers that i tested my site on were:
- **[Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox)** My site opened perfectly, and was fully responsive with no issues arising.
- **[Opera](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera)** My site opened perfectly, and was fully responsive with no issues arising.
- **[Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome)** My site opened perfectly, and was fully responsive with no issues arising.
- **[Safari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safair)** On uploading my site to safari i noticed that the main image was too large, everything else on the site worked perfectly.

    ### Acknowledgement
    --------------------
    
    This project was inspired by my little daughter and her love for people and horses. In her eyes all children are equal no matter their circumstances and combining that with her love for horses and everything horsey gave rise to a project that can grow as my knowledge grows.
