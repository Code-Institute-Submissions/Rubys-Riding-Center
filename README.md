## RUBY'S RIDING CENTER
---------------------------

### What is the progect all about?

Ruby's Riding Center is a riding center for children of all ages. We believe children and horses have an amazing connection which builds confidence and healing.
We also cater for children with all types of disabilities be it physical or mental.

Children should all be able to feel normal. Being on, or close to a horse, gives them a special connection that empowers them. Results have been amazing to witness.

    ### Acknowledgement
