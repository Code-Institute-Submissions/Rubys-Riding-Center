## RUBY'S RIDING CENTER
---------------------------

### What is the progect all about?

Ruby's Riding Center is a riding center for children of all ages. We believe children and horses have an amazing connection which builds confidence and healing.
We also cater for children with all types of disabilities be it physical or mental.

Children should all be able to feel normal. Being on, or close to a horse, gives them a special connection that empowers them. Results have been amazing to witness.

### Functionality of Project
The core of this project is written in HTML5 and CSS3. These two programs were used in conjunction with Bootstrap 4 to create a website that is responsive on mobile, tablet, laptop and desk top devices.

The fonts used throughout the project were imported from google fonts and are called <a https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Merriweather:400,700|Roboto+Slab">'Merriweather/Roboto'</a>

 * As a parent, I want my child to have fun while being safe.

* Allowing the parent to be able to contact the school with questions and queries via the "Message us" form.

_As a developer:_

    ### Acknowledgement
    --------------------
