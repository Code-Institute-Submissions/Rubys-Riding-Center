## RUBY'S RIDING CENTER
---------------------------

### What is the project all about?

Ruby's Riding Center is a riding center for children of all ages. We believe children and horses have an amazing connection which builds confidence and healing.
We also cater for children with all types of disabilities be it physical or mental.

Children should all be able to feel normal. Being on, or close to a horse, gives them a special connection that empowers them. Results have been amazing to witness.

### User Experience
---------------------

#### User stories:

 _The site user (The Parent):_

 * As a parent , I want to find a place where my child can learn about horses and how to ride.
 * As a parent, I want to build my childs confidence.
 * As a parent, I want my child to have fun while being safe.
 * As a parent, I want to hear what others have to say about the place.
 * As a parent, I want my child to feel normal.

 For the site user (The Parent), the site assists by fulfilling these goals by:
* Being written in clean aesthetically pleasing code and by being visually stimulating.
* Having a site that is fully responsive.
* Having comments from current and previous parents visable.
* Allowing the parent to be able to contact the school with questions and queries via the "Message us" form.
* Feeling confident that this is a school that meets their needs.

 _As a site owner (The Riding School):_
* The site must be visuallly inviting to both children and their parents.
* It must forfill a need- To get children to come and ride, to grow in confidence around horses and to heal.
* To show the bond that is created between horses and their riders.

_As a developer:_
* To create a visual experience that showcases the essence of the riding center.
* To create a living project. Something that can grow and be upgraded as the knowledge is expanded.

### Testing:
   ------------
   - **HTML:** The HTML Validator https://validator.w3.org/ was used to validate the HTML code.
   - **CSS:** The CSS Validator https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input was used to validate the css code.
   
   When running both of these validators in the beginning i found a few errors mainly typos and trailing div's. There were also some warnings for code that was correct and could be ignored. On correcting what needed to be corrected,  the code works well.

### Features and responsive testing:

Chrome Dev tools was used alongside all my written code to make sure i was getting the responsiveness and size correct for the different pages.

- **Responsiveness per page**

- **Home Page:** 
    - On mobile the navigation bar is collapsed to a hamberger menu (three lines).
    - The "What We Encourage" section has the photos and descriptions aligned one under each other.
    - The "What Our Parents Say" section is also aligned one ontop of the other and looks neat.

    - On IPAD-PRO the navigation bar is expanded and you can now see the different page names.
    - The "What We Encourage" section now has 2 rows with 3 photos next to each other in each row.
    - The "What Our Parents Say" section is now in one row and the 3 stories are next to each other.

    - The "What Our Parents Say" section is now in one row and the 3 stories are next to each other.
  
- **Lessons Page:** 
    - On mobile the navigation bar is collapsed to a hamberger menu (three lines). On clicking it the navigation bar appears with all pages listed, so it is easy to move between the pages.
    - The "What We Teach" section has the photos and descriptions of the photos aligned one under each other.
    - At the bottom of the page is a description and insight into an actual riding lesson in the form of a short video.

    - On IPAD-PRO the navigation bar is expanded and you can now see the different page names.
    - The "What We Teach" section has now expanded into 3 pictures accross the page with the 4th below in a second row.
    ( I originally had the photos one below the other with the writing to the right of it but could not get the alignment correct. This way the alignment works.)
    - The video is responsive accross all page sizes.

    -On full screen the page looks the same as on the ipad-pro just a little larger.

- **Accessories Page:** 
     - On mobile the navigation bar is collapsed to a hamberger menu (three lines). On clicking it the navigation bar appears with all pages listed.
     - In the middle of the page is "Our Shop". The items and their descriptions are shown one below the next.
     - Each item has a "Buy Now" button which will in future link to a shopping cart.
     - At the bottom of the page is a sign up form for a bi-weekly newsletter, to people informed of events and upcoming compertitions and get togethers.

    - Below the map is the "Message us" form. A contact form for the parents to get hold of the riding center.
    - Below is a Beautiful photo of horses stating "We Look Forward To Seeing You" which leaves the client with a happy feeling.

    - On IPAD-PRO the navigation bar is now expanded and the page links can be seen.
    - In the middle of the page the map and the message form are now next together. ( i had a problem with them throwing the alignment out on the page, this is why they are so close together.)

    -On full screen the page looks the same as on the ipad-pro just a little larger.

   - **Web-dev:** Web-dev measures your site to see how well it supporst your users and what you can do to increase your rate of support. Handy little tool.

### Problems and bugs
- **Bootstrap and alignment:** The issue of allignment took me a very long time to sort out. With the help from the folks on slack and my mentor i found that my order for bootstrap was incorrect. I was directed to watch a video which Anna (one of the tutors) made just on bootstrap.
On correcting the order, things seemed to work better.
I still have a problem with overflow in the navigation top blue bar which i have been unable to correct.

* Contact form works as it should.
    * Go to the Our Newsletter Sign up
    * if the user does not enter an email the user will get the error - "Please include and @ in the email address".
    * If the user doesn not enter the email correctly and only
    enters abc@ the error message will say " Please enter the part following the @. This is incomplete.
* This works the same for the "Message Us form".
* this website is responsive from mobile up to large screen resolutions.

### Testing on Web Browsers:

The web browsers that i tested my site on were:
- **[Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox)** My site opened perfectly, and was fully responsive with no issues arising.
- **[Opera](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera)** My site opened perfectly, and was fully responsive with no issues arising.
- **[Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome)** My site opened perfectly, and was fully responsive with no issues arising.
- **[Safari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safair)** On uploading my site to safari i noticed that the main image was too large, everything else on the site worked perfectly.

    ### Acknowledgement
    --------------------
    
    This project was inspired by my little daughter and her love for people and horses. In her eyes all children are equal no matter their circumstances and combining that with her love for horses and everything horsey gave rise to a project that can grow as my knowledge grows.
