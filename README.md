RUBY'S RIDING CENTER

Ruby's Riding Center is a riding center for children of all ages. We cater for children with all types of disabilities be it physical or mental.

Children should all be able to feel normal and being on, or close to a horse, gives them a special connection that empowers them. Results have been amazing to witness.

         --------------------------

What We Encourage is a breakdown of how we get through to children and get them to open up, trust and connect to the horses.

We are happy to have feedback from our parens and always encourage comments.

What We Teach is a build on to what we encourage.Weshow the children how to tack up their horses correctly. How to mount correctly or how to sit is specialised sadles if needed.We encourage laughter ad fun above all else.
