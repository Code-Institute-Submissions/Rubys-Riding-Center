### Testing:
   ------------
   - **HTML:** The HTML Validator https://validator.w3.org/ was used to validate the HTML code.
   - **CSS:** The CSS Validator https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input was used to validate the css code.
   
   When running both of these validators in the beginning i found a few errors mainly typos and trailing div's. There were also some warnings for code that was correct and could be ignored. On correcting what needed to be corrected,  the code works well.

### Features and responsive testing:

Chrome Dev tools was used alongside all my written code to make sure i was getting the responsiveness and size correct for the different pages.
  
   - **Web-dev:** Web-dev measures your site to see how well it supporst your users and what you can do to increase your rate of support. Handy little tool.

### Problems and bugs
- **Bootstrap and alignment:** The issue of allignment took me a very long time to sort out. With the help from the folks on slack and my mentor i found that my order for bootstrap was incorrect. I was directed to watch a video which Anna (one of the tutors) made just on bootstrap.
On correcting the order, things seemed to work better.
